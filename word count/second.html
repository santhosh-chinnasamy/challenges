        <p id="second">General-purpose languages are the languages you’ve likely heard of such as Java, Javascript, Ruby, C++, & Python.
            Among the general-purpose languages, one can find infinite ways to further categorize them by qualitative & quantitative
            differences & similarities such as readability, compiling, strictly-typed, frontend/backend, etc… A good rule
            of thumb on first-time friendliness is as follows: Javascript, Python, & Ruby are generally easier for newcomers
            as they have less of a learning curve while C++ & Java usually take more time to learn out of the box. Note,
            the editor is refraining from commenting on second & third-level consequences of a newcomer starting off with
            one group of languages or the other. There are multiple debates across further features of these languages, such
            as forcing newcomers to understand variable types first through a strictly-typed language that we’re circumventing
            to maximize usage here for a new developer approaching strictly the blockchain space. The biggest pro for newcomers
            picking up a general-purpose is the immediate ability to apply that language in a vast number of fields outside
            of blockchain programming. Unfortunately, the flipside of that same coin creates a con for those newcomers looking
            to join the job market as you’ll likely compete directly against senior & veteran software engineers from other
            domains with years of experience wielding said general-purpose language.</p>
