            The most common misconception about side projects? That starting one will distract you from your real job. Or tire you out.
            Or just complicate things. But in fact, the opposite is true. Fiddling around in new territories will actually
            make you better at the stuff you already know. I love chatting to staff about their side projects and hobbies.
            For one thing, it shows they have enough free time and security to take pleasure in things beyond their job.
            But usually, their personal interests end up informing their work at JotForm. Dawn Sharifan, Slack’s director
            of People Operations, agrees, “At the core of it, people that have hobbies or side projects say that they are
            on a path for continued improvement, intellectual curiosity and well roundedness.” Another side project advocate
            is Google, which famously allows their employees to spend 20 percent of their time exploring them. It’s thanks
            to this system that Gmail, Google News and AdSense came about. Spotify hosts week-long hackathons to encourage
            staff to explore their passions. Even Y Combinator asks its applicants for a side project idea when they apply.
